## Getting started

* Install node.js (get it from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/)).
  * If working behind a proxy, you need to configure it properly (HTTP_PROXY / HTTPS_PROXY / NO_PROXY environment variables)

* Clone the repository and navigate into it
```
cd ui5con-cf-todo
```

* Install all dependencies and start the server
```sh
npm install
node server.js
```
This will make your application available at http://localhost:4000
